˚❀༉‧ CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
Training a CNN from a dataset of images to be able to determine potability of water from a live stream or video. 
Feature Complexity: While the model can identify visual features like clarity, 
it might struggle to accurately predict complex water parameters such as PHlevels or organic matter from an image alone.
